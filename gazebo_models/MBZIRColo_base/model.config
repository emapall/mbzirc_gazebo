    A copy of the 3DR Iris model taken from
    https://github.com/PX4/sitl_gazebo/tree/master/models
    Local modifications include adding standoffs,
    inertia and collision updates..

    This is the base model in the sense that it includes the base inertias and physical links.
    The demo part of this model will include the gimball and the various plugins
